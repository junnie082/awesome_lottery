## What?
A website where you can manage all of your students' points in Awesome English class and do lottery games. 

## Why?
I have worked as an English instructor at Awesome English for 3 years. I thought it would be great if I could automate the process of giving the students points whenever they do good. I quit this work in November 2024, and I still developed the program, not for me, but for Alex.  

## How?

### Main Screen

### Dashboard

You can create your own Dashboard. So if you have C level class at 2:30, A at 3:30, ... you can set your own level and time accordingly.

You can manage all of your students at once. Give the points to each student, or to all in class.

### Members 

You can check individual's points, stamps and chances. 
5 points is same as 1 stamp.
30 stamps is same is 1 chance.

Students can do lottery games as many as chances you have.

You can cancel the points that you already gave, or add points here.
